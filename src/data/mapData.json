Its depth ranges 3–14m below the surface of the lake, where vertical visibility is about 8–10 m. This made it very easy for the research team to see the archaeological remains during their work.",
    "notes": "The fourteenth to early fifteenth century dates for Pontada coincide with a time when Indonesia was experiencing major economic and political developments, notably the emergence of the Majapahit Empire in Java. Interestingly, Muljana (2006:213) interprets the eleventh stanza of the fourteenth century Nāgarakrtāgama epic poem as telling of a journey made by King Hayam Wuruk of Majapahit to Luwu or Matano. The basis for such a trip would have been to trade in pamor luwu, which was being imported to Majapahit Java from coastal Luwu, notably for the manufacture of kris daggers (Do 2013; Reid 1988:110; Solyom and Solyom 1978). Additional evidence of the presence of Javanese from Majapahit in Luwu is seen in the fourteenth to fifteenth century coastal capital of Malangke, which includes a mounded site called Tampung Jawa (meaning Javanese burial ground). The mound contains the oldest clay bricks in South Sulawesi, which may reflect Majapahit technological influence in the region (Bulbeck and Caldwell 2000; Hakim 2000). Such archaeological evidence for Majapahit Javanese presence in coastal Luwu opens the possibility that Javanese blacksmiths migrated to Lake Matano, where they could have passed on their knowledge to local inhabitants. A Javanese connection is further suggested by the kendi with lateral spouts found at Lake Matano; the suspected loom spools also point to an exogenous influence.",
